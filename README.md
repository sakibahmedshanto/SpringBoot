# Initializing a Project

1. we have basic dependency package->
goto maven central repo and search
-> spring-boot-starter-web
-> copy that piece of code to pom.xml


2. dont add version no to the pom.xml
cause its parent may have already working version that will be automaticaly inherited . and if the parent hasnt any version the system will use the latest version
-> more neat clean code
-> more stable versioning


#Annotations
Great question! In Spring Boot (or Spring Framework in general), annotations like @Controller and @RequestMapping are used to tell the framework how to handle HTTP requests and map them to Java methods. Theyâ€™re part of Springâ€™s annotation-based configuration system.
